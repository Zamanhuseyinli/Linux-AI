## **Linux Artificial Intelligence and Automation Structure**

This project is based on large language models and a system-level automation framework. It enables users to interact with the system through kernel modules, while the AI layer handles I/O, device, and system components as if it were part of a robotic intelligence structure.

Tasks that would normally require manual effort are handled quickly and efficiently by the AI system, allowing for smoother and more autonomous interactions with your Linux environment.

Currently, the project supports core components such as I/O management, CPU control, and PCIe (PCIO) operations. If you'd like to contribute to the project, the source code is open.

## **Kernel-Integrated Layers and Modules**

Due to certain limitations in device support, this project does **not** provide integration with closed-source solutions such as `nvidia-smi` or similar proprietary APIs. However, I plan to document a `proc-GPU` support structure for contributors who wish to implement or extend such features.

I currently offer support for Intel, AMD, and other integrated GPU and CPU components.

> This is an experimental prototype.  
> It is **highly recommended** to install and test it in a virtual machine first.  
> Errors or unexpected behavior may occur on physical devices.

## ** DE-AI**
DE-AI is an artificial intelligence system management structure that adapts to desktop environments developed for desktop environments. In this structure, desktop environment ai version variations have emerged.The above mentioned things are only valid for those who want to build the AI ​​system structure directly on the kernel.
